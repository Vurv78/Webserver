This is the source code of my webserver hosted with python flask, being rewritten in Haxe.
Hopefully in the future this will auto-pull to pythonanywhere.

### Why is this a repo?
I'm putting this here so people can learn from what my website does, how to set up a CI in Haxe, etc.

### Why am I rewriting it in Haxe?
Because Haxe is typed, looks better and overall I don't really like python's syntax. Haxe solves all of this and It's been a really nice project
